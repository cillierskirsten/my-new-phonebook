<h1>PhoneBook - My First Project Font-End Development Project</h1>
<p>--March 2020--<br/></p>
<h2>What is my-new-phonebook?</h2>
<p>My phonebook is simple Phone Book entry application created using Front-End Development technology. This was one of my requirements which had to be completed as part of an online Front-End Developer Workshop </p>
<h2>The Course and Instructor</h2>
<p>The course was an Instructor-Led online training course hosted by <a href="https://www.knowledgehut.com/" target="_blank">Knowledge Hut</a> and run by <a href="https://github.com/puranik3" target="_blank">Prashanth Puranik</a>. Prashanth is a freelance web developer and corporate trainer. He is primarily trained on JS-based Technologies (for both Front - and Back-End.) His delivery and understanding of subject matter was second to none. His natural ability for imparting knowledge created the perfect environment to streamline my learnings in becoming a Front-End Developer, or at least have learnt enough to be able to hold my own during the "more technical" debates hosted by seasoned developers.</p>
<h2>The Objectives</h2>
<p>The course objectives were to teach students how to build effective, stunning and interactive websites with advanced navigation and multimedia. It introduced the fundamentals of the three building blocks of all modern websites - jQuery, HTML5 and CSS3 with the main focus on JavaScript. Throughout sessions I had to complete in-lecture exercises and coding challenges, and were given comprehensive tasks outside of class to complete in preparation for the following lessons.</p>
